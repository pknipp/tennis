Components to create for admin:
approve user, create date, delete date, roster which includes "private" data
insertion of a special date (Mon or Fri for a 3-day weekend?)

test the automation of the creation of the next week's dates (& reservations) when a weekend passes

include "isPrivate" column in User model (and use this to hide phone numbers on roster?)
use localstorage to store password?
change photo_url to use user's id#?
User faker to seed phone numbers (and first names, if these can be generated uniquely?)
allow the user to toggle the display of availabilities for past dates
temporarily delete proPics folder, to make it disappear from GH (and master)?
